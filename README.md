# Binary Classification using scikit-learn
We took up a binary classification task and used scikit-learn to achieve it. We extensively studied the tradeoffs between performance, accuracy and the level of preprocessing required for the following algorithms (and ensemble methods).
 - Decision Tree
 - SVM (with linear and RBF kernels)
 - k-Nearest Neighbors
 - Naive-Bayes
 - Random Forest
 - Adaboost

A technical report for the project detailing the results can be found [here](project760_final_report.pdf). The report includes precision-recall plots for the aforementioned learning algorithms. All of the plots can be found under `plots/`
